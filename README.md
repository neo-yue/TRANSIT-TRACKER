# TRANSIT-TRACKER
Track the real-time location of buses on Halifax bus routes 1-10
This project uses fetch API to get the transit coordinate information provided by the Halifax Transit API. Then filter to get the bus data of the selected route, and then convert the data to GeoJSON format. Finally use Leaflet to display the bus's location on the map in real time.
